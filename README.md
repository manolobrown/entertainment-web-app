## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I expanded my knowledge of v-model to create search filters.

### Continued development

I'm continuing to learn how the composition api works. I need to get better with code abstraction and also need to create components more fluidly.

### Useful resources
